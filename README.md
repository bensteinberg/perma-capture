## Development

### Spin up some containers

Start up the Docker containers in the background:

    $ docker-compose up -d

The first time this runs it will build the Docker images, which
may take several minutes. (After the first time, it should only take
1-3 seconds.)

Then log into the main Docker container:

    $ docker-compose exec web bash

(Commands from here on out that start with `#` are being run in Docker.)

### Run Django

You should now have a working installation!

Migrate the database:

    # ./manage.py migrate

Install the node dependencies:

    # cd frontend
    # yarn install
    # cd ../

Spin up the development server:

    # fab run_fullstack

Create a test admin user (follow the prompts, then log in using those credentials):

    # ./manage.py createsuperuser

### Optional: load some sample data

To more fully explore the UI, you may want to load some sample data.

    # fab load_sample_capture_jobs

See [fabfile.py](https://github.com/harvard-lil/perma-capture/blob/develop/web/fabfile.py#L71)
for a fuller discussion of options.


### Stop

When you are finished, spin down Docker containers by running:

    $ docker-compose down

Your database will persist and will load automatically the next time you run `docker-compose up -d`.

Or, you can clean up everything Docker-related, so you can start fresh, as with a new installation:

    $ bash docker/clean.sh


## Testing

### Test Commands

1. `pytest` runs python tests
1. `flake8` runs python lints

### Coverage

Coverage will be generated automatically for all manually-run tests.

## Migrations

We use standard Django migrations
